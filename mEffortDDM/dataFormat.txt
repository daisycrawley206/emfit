The data for subject sj should be contained in Data(sj) in the format containing
the following fields:


 Data(sj).ID 					subject ID 
 Data(sj).Nch     			number of valid choices by this subject 

 Data(sj).a 					Nchx1 vector of chioces 
                              1 = low rew/low effort, 2 = high rew/high effort
 Data(sj).rew 					Nchx1 vector of rewards for high reward option 
                              (low reward option is always 1) 

 Data(sj).EffortcostLo		effort associated with low effort option 
                              (action 1) - default = -1 (NB: should be negative)
 Data(sj).EffortcostHi		effort associated with action high effort option 
                              (action 2) - default = -0.2 (NB: should be negative)

 Data(sj).decisiontime  	Nchx1 vector times to first button press
 Data(sj).inputtime			Nchx1 vector of durations of input 
                              (last - first button press time)

An example data file can be generated with generateExampleDataset.m for the model llreweffscalingDDMBSP. 
This model conists of the analytical version of the drift
diffusion model by Navarro % Fuss (2009). Its fits parameters for the starting point, 
the boundary and non-decision time. The drift rate contains a standard model 
for effort and reward evaluation, which assumes participants weigh both rewards and
effort in their choices. The later model fits a weight for the rewards and the efforts.
