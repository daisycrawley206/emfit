Pruning task 

The data for subject sj should be contained in D(sj) in the following format:

 Data(sj).ID 		subject ID 
 Data(sj).Nch 	= length(Data(sj).a);

 Data(sj).choices 	dmax x nTotal matrix of choices, 
                     the sequence of choices on trial i in row i 
 Data(sj).rewards 	dmax x nTotal matrix of rewards 
                     the sequence of rewards on trial i in row i 
 Data(sj).states 		dmax+1 x nTotal matrix of states 
                     the sequence of states on trial i in row i 
 Data(sj).depths		nTotal x 1 vector of depths 


where dmax is the maximum depth of plans (e.g. 6) and nTotal is the total number
of trials subject sj was presented with.  The matrices contain 0 as fillers for
sequences shorter than dmax such that Data(sj).depths = sum(Data(sj).choices~=0,2);

Providing the above to the function EXTRACTVALIDTRIALS.m will add the following,
which is required for the scripts to run: 

 Data(sj).i				Nch x 1 vector of valid trials 
 Data(sj).nTotal		total number of choices
 Data(sj).Nch			number of valid trials 
 Data(sj).a				Nch x dmax matrix of valid choices
 Data(sj).s				Nch x dmax+1 matrix of valid states visited
 Data(sj).r				Nch x dmax matrix of valid rewards earned 
 Data(sj).d				Nch x dmax matrix of choices remaining 
 Data(sj).ri			Nch x dmax matrix of reward identities
 Data(sj).an			Nch x 1 vector of action sequence identities 
 Data(sj).sn			Nch x 1 vector of starting states 
 Data(sj).dn			Nch x 1 vector of depths 
 Data(sj).transitions Nch x dmax vector of transition identities 

An example file can be generated with generateExampleDataset.m.
